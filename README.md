MyCords is a simple yet powerful addon that provides essential location data to help players navigate the vast world of Azeroth. It displays your current map ID, instance ID, and X/Y coordinates on the map, giving you precise details about your location in open-world zones. This addon automatically disables itself in battlegrounds, instances, and dungeons to ensure it stays focused on outdoor exploration.

    Map ID and Instance ID Display: Shows the unique Map ID and Instance ID of your current location, giving you detailed information about where you are in the game world.
    X and Y Coordinates: Displays your exact position on the map using X and Y coordinates, allowing for precise navigation.
    No Data in Battlegrounds, Instances, or Dungeons: Automatically disables functionality when you enter battlegrounds, instances, or dungeons to focus solely on open-world exploration.

How It Affects User Experience:

    Precise Navigation: Whether you're farming materials, hunting rare mobs, or questing, knowing your exact coordinates makes it easier to find specific locations or return to key spots.
    Easy Communication of Location: Sharing your map coordinates with others becomes simple, making it easier to guide teammates, organize groups, or meet up with friends in the same zone.
    Minimal Disruption: By automatically disabling in battlegrounds, instances, and dungeons, the addon remains focused on what matters—navigating the outdoor world—without cluttering your interface with unnecessary data in other areas of the game.
